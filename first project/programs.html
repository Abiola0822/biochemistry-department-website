        <p>Biochemistry is a science discipline basic to Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Pharmacology, Physiotherapy, 
            Physiology, Radiography, Biotechnology, Biological Sciences, Agriculture, Nutrition and Food Science.
            The Department of Biochemistry of the University of Lagos located at the College of Medicine Idi-araba 
            Campus is equipped to teach and carry out research in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
            As a primary function, the Department offers courses in Biochemistry to Medicine and Dentistry students 
            at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos.</p>
        <p>The Department runs a four-year degree programme for the Faculty of Science, Akoka campus, leading to a 
            B.Sc. (Hons) Degree in Biochemistry. The Department also runs Postgraduate programmes for the School of 
            Postgraduate Studies leading to M.Sc, M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees in Biochemistry.</p>
        <p>The Department also teaches Biochemistry as a service course to students majoring in other B.Sc (Hons) 
            degrees in the College of Medicine (Radiology, Physiotherapy, Nursing, Medical lab Science, Pharmacology, 
            Physiology Students of the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences and Clinical Science), Faculty of Science and 
            the Faculty of Pharmacy, as well as thelnstitute of Medical Laboratory Technology, Post Basic School of 
            Nursing and finally, to Medical Doctors, Resident Doctors and Dental Surgeons-students of the National 
            and West African Postgraduate Medical and Dental Colleges.
        <p>With the current trend in the life sciences, especially with the pace of development in several areas, 
            such as Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, Immunology, Neuroscience, Food Science and Forensic Science, 
            the Department has expanded the B.Sc. Biochemistry programme to include these rapidly developing areas. 
            The goal of training students in these areas is to produce experts who will be competent to contribute to 
            national development and meet current needs of the Society through research and generation of new ideas 
            and products.</p>
        <p>The Department has been organized into specific research groups such as: Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, 
            Toxicology, Proteins and Enzymology, Biomembranes, Neuroscience, Food Science, Nutrition, Natural Products, 
            Environmental Biochemistry and Hormonal Biochemistry. Many papers have been published in these areas by 
            members of staff of the Department. Some of the areas which have received national and international 
            attention as well as grant support from both public and private sectors.</p>
        <p>In addition, some products such as wines, milk and condiments from plant sources and chicken feed have 
            been produced and exhibited at research fairs.
            The Department renders services to hospitals and private patients in the areas of clinical Bacteriology, 
            Parasitology, Virology/immunology and Mycology. Emphasis is placed on the clinical and epidemiological 
            approach to microbial, protozoal and helminthic diseases with appropriate laboratory methods for 
            diagnosis and management of clinical cases.</p>
